###Voltronerabilities:
I was not able to get in to AJ's learning journal.  I tried some version of all 8 security vulnerabilities in the tutorial.  
First I tried a handful of the SQL injection snippets that worked in the tutorial.  Despite a database full of entries, I never got my hands on any of them, or a username/pw.

Looking through his code, everything's pretty well protected, except for CSRF.  I didn't try any of that because I don't write sufficient JS to take advantage of it.

I couldn't find any examples of misconfig or IDOR.  It doesn't help that there's no debug mode in Pyramid, so it's not as obvious as it was in the tutorial.
